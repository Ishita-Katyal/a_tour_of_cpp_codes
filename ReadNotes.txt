1. C is a procedural language.
2. C++ is a compiled language: For a program to run, its source text (source files) has to be processed by a 
   compiler, producing object files combined by a linker yielding executable program.
3. An executable program is created for a specific hardware/system combo
4. Executable is not portable; but source code is
5. ISO C++ standard defines 2 types of entities:
   5a. Core language features: built-in-types (char, int) and loops (for, while)
   5b. Standard Library Components: containers (vecor, map) and I/O operations (<<, getline)
6. C++ is statically-types: type of every entity must be known to the compiler at its point of use.
7. main is a global function in C++. Program starts by executing that function.
8. main returns an int value to the system.
9. A non-zero return value from main() indicates failure.
10. std::cout<< and std::cin>> are output and input streams respectively.
11. In a string literal, a backslash denoted by a single character afterwards denotes a special character
    also called escape sequences.
12. \n --> new line
13. never use if, if, if, else instead if, else if, else if, else if the if conditional is about the same
    variable.
14. Argument types are checked and implicit argument type conversion takes place when necessary.
15. Function Overloading: When a function is overloaded, each function of teh same name should implement the
    same semantics
16. Declaration: statement that introduces a name into the program specifying the type for names entity.
17. Type: defines a set of possible values and a set of operations.
18. Object: some memory taht holds a value of some type.
19. Value: set of bits interpreted according to a type.
20. Variable: named object.
21. Fundamental types in C++: bool(true/false, 1), char('a'-'z','0'-'9', 1), int(-infinity to +infinity, 4), 
    double(floats, 8), unsigned(non-negative int)
22. Logical Operators:
    x&y  //bitwise and
    x|y  //bitwise or
    x^y  //bitwise exclusive or
    ~x   //bitwise complement
    x&&y //logical and
    x||y //logical or
23. Curly-brace-delimited initializer. For instance double d2 {2.3}: general list form;
24. Conversions that lose information: Narrowing conversions such as double to int and int to char are implicitly 
    applied. ~ imp for C compatibility
25. When defining a variable, one doesn't need to state its type explicitly when it can be deduced from the 
    initializer: auto b = true, auto ch = "x", auto = 123, auto d = 1.23, auto z = sqrt(y)
26. With Auto, we use = because there is no potentially troublesome type conversion involved.
